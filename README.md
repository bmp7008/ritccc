### This is the web site for the RIT Chinese Conversation Club.

There's one thing that all the best clubs have in common: a good web presence.

The purpose of this site is to make taking attendance, tracking members, taking suggestions, and other kinds of communication easier.

The site should grow in form and function alongside the club.
